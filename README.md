# ML Web App using Gradio - Iris Dataset Classifier
Iris Dataset

This repository contains code for a Machine Learning (ML) web application built using Gradio, which allows users to classify iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a widely used dataset for beginners in machine learning, and it contains measurements of iris flowers with their corresponding species labels.

The web app uses a trained ML model to make predictions on new iris samples and displays the results to the users in an intuitive and user-friendly way.

# Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and a corresponding species label (setosa, versicolor, or virginica). The dataset is a classic and straightforward dataset, ideal for classification tasks and learning the basics of ML algorithms.

# Prerequisites
Before running the web app, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Python 3.6+
Gradio (install using pip install gradio)
